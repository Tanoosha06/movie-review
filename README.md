movie review classification

sentiment analysis model using a dataset of movie reviews to classify them as positive or negative. Clean and preprocess the text data by removing noise and converting it into a suitable format for analysis. Choose a classification algorithm such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or a deep learning approach like LSTM or Transformers. Train the model on labeled reviews to learn patterns indicative of sentiment. Evaluate its accuracy using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to gauge its effectiveness in sentiment classification. This model aims to automate and improve the process of analyzing movie reviews for sentiment.
